## The question:
Given a set of integers, sort it using a predefined set of instructions using two stacks. The instruction set is defined below. This program outputs a program in push_swap instructions that sorts the input integers.

## Summary form subject
This project will make you sort data on a stack, with a limited set of instructions, using the lowest possible number of actions. To succeed you'll have to manipulate various types of algorithm and choose the one (of many) most appropriate solution for an optimizing data sorting.

## Command are...

- sa : swap a - swap the first 2 elements at the top of stack a. Do nothing if there
is only one or no elements).
- sb : swap b - swap the first 2 elements at the top of stack b. Do nothing if there
is only one or no elements).
- ss : sa and sb at the same time.
- pa : push a - take the first element at the top of b and put it at the top of a. Do
nothing if b is empty.
- pb : push b - take the first element at the top of a and put it at the top of b. Do
nothing if a is empty.
- ra : rotate a - shift up all elements of stack a by 1. The first element becomes
the last one.
- rb : rotate b - shift up all elements of stack b by 1. The first element becomes
the last one.
- rr : ra and rb at the same time.
- rra : reverse rotate a - shift down all elements of stack a by 1. The flast element
becomes the first one.
- rrb : reverse rotate b - shift down all elements of stack b by 1. The flast element
becomes the first one.
- rrr : rra and rrb at the same time.

## My logic
I use redix sort. First, label the order of numbers in stack. Encode it in binary and then perform a radix sort using 0 and 1 for A and B. BOOM! done. <br>
Well, I know it's not that easy but I see the possibility in you! <br>
May the force be with you.
